        compute the heuristic cost, only to generate the possible SWAPs to evaluate
        with this heuristic. The SABRE heuristic only uses the distance matrix.
        Nevertheless, this implementation uses the hardware data to check if some
        gates are ignored (such as barriers for example).
    :param front_layer: the current front layer. Used to compute an "immediate" cost,
        i.e. a quantity that will tell us if the SWAP/Bridge is useful to execute
        gates in the front layer.
    :param topological_nodes: the list of all the DAGNodes of the quantum circuit,
        sorted in topological order.
    :param current_node_index: index of the first non-processed node.
    :param current_mapping: the mapping *before* applying the given SWAP.
    :param distance_matrix: the pre-computed distance matrix between each qubits.
    :param tentative_gate: the SWAP we want to estimate the usefulness of.
    :param look_ahead_depth: the depth of the look-ahead. The procedure will consider
        gates that will be executed in the future (i.e. not in the front layer) up to
        the given depth. Note that 1-qubit gates are not ignored, which means that a
        depth of 3 will not guarantee that there is at least 3 CNOTs in the
        look-ahead set.
    :param look_ahead_weight: weight of the look-ahead. The actual gates (i.e. the
        gates in the front layer) have a weight of 1.
    :return: the heuristic cost of the given SWAP/Bridge according to the current
